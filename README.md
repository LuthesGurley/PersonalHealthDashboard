# Personal Health Dashboard

The **Personal Health Dashboard** is a locally-hosted web application designed to help users track and visualize personal health metrics, such as diet (calorie intake) and vitals (weight), in a private and secure environment. Running entirely on the user's machine, it ensures data privacy while providing a modern, responsive interface for logging health data and viewing trends through interactive charts, such as weight history over time. Built with a robust tech stack, the project integrates Angular for the frontend, NestJS for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Docker for containerized deployment, all automated via a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

The application enables users to log health entries, interact with a RESTful API for data management, and visualize their health progress, making it ideal for those seeking a self-contained, privacy-focused health tracking solution without cloud dependencies.

## Project Overview

The Personal Health Dashboard was developed with the following goals:
- **Health Tracking**: Allow users to easily log diet and vital statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Provide intuitive charts to monitor health trends, like weight changes.
- **Privacy and Security**: Keep all data local to the userâ€™s machine for full control.
- **Automation**: Streamline development, testing, and deployment with a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Modular Design**: Separate frontend, backend, and database for maintainability.

This project showcases a full-stack application with modern development practices, including containerization, automated testing, and continuous integration, serving as both a practical health tool and a reference for developers.

## Features

- **Health Data Logging**:
  - Record diet entries with calorie details (e.g., 600 calories).
  - Track vital measurements, such as weight (e.g., 147 lbs).
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Dynamic weight history chart using Chart.js and ng2-charts.
  - User-friendly interface powered by Angular Material.
- **RESTful API**:
  - Endpoints for health data management:
    - `GET /api/health`: Retrieve all health records.
    - `POST /api/health`: Log new health data.
    - `GET /api/health/weight`: Fetch weight history.
- **Local Deployment**:
  - Docker containers for frontend, backend, and MongoDB ensure consistent environments.
- **Automated CI/CD**:
  - Jenkins pipeline automates code checkout, builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Persistent Storage**:
  - MongoDB stores health metrics locally, preserving data across sessions.
- **Responsive Frontend**:
  - Optimized for desktop browsers, with potential for mobile enhancements.
